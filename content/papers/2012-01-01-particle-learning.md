This paper presents an approach for online parameter estimation within particle filters. Current research has mainly been focused towards the estimation of static parameters. However, in scenarios of target maneuver-ability, it is often necessary to update the parameters of the model to meet the changing conditions of the target. The novel aspect of the proposed approach lies in the estimation of non-static parameters which change at some unknown point in time. Our parameter estimation is updated using change point analysis, where a change point is identified when a significant change occurs in the observations of the system, such as changes in direction or velocity.
